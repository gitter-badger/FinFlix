Google Drive
Paths are specified as drive:path

Drive paths may be as deep as required, eg drive:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`. First run:

 `rclone config`
This will guide you through an interactive setup process:
```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n
name> remote

Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine or Y didn't work
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code

y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n

--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

`rclone lsd remote:`
List all the files in your drive

`rclone ls remote:`
To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

`rclone copy /home/source remote:backup`
Team drives
If you want to configure the remote to point to a Google Team Drive then answer y to the question Configure this as a team drive?.

This will fetch the list of Team Drives from google and allow you to configure which one you want to use. You can also type in a team drive ID if you prefer.

For example:
```
Configure this as a team drive?
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
Fetching team drive list...
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Rclone Test
   \ "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
 2 / Rclone Test 2
   \ "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
 3 / Rclone Test 3
   \ "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

Modified time
Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.

Revisions
Google drive stores revisions of files. When you upload a change to an existing file to google drive using rclone it will create a new revision of that file.

Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was

They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
They do not count towards a user storage quota.
Deleting files
By default rclone will delete files permanently when requested. If sending them to the trash is required instead then use the --drive-use-trash flag.

Specific options
Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage system.

--drive-auth-owner-only

Only consider files owned by the authenticated user.

--drive-chunk-size=SIZE

Upload chunk size. Must a power of 2 >= 256k. Default value is 8 MB.

Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk is buffered in memory one per transfer.

Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.

--drive-auth-owner-only

Only consider files owned by the authenticated user.

--drive-formats

Google documents can only be exported from Google drive. When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download depending upon this setting.

By default the formats are docx,xlsx,pptx,svg which are a sensible default for an editable document.

When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order and chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the list. If the file can’t be exported to a format on the formats list, then rclone will choose a format from the default list.

If you prefer an archive copy then you might use --drive-formats pdf, or if you prefer openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use --drive-formats ods,odt,odp.

Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is calles My Spreadsheet on google docs, it will be exported as My Spreadsheet.xlsx or My Spreadsheet.pdf etc.

Here are the possible extensions with their corresponding mime types.

Extension	Mime Type	Description
csv	text/csv	Standard CSV format for Spreadsheets
doc	application/msword	Micosoft Office Document
docx	application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document	Microsoft Office Document
epub	application/epub+zip	E-book format
html	text/html	An HTML Document
jpg	image/jpeg	A JPEG Image File
odp	application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation	Openoffice Presentation
ods	application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet	Openoffice Spreadsheet
ods	application/x-vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet	Openoffice Spreadsheet
odt	application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text	Openoffice Document
pdf	application/pdf	Adobe PDF Format
png	image/png	PNG Image Format
pptx	application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation	Microsoft Office Powerpoint
rtf	application/rtf	Rich Text Format
svg	image/svg+xml	Scalable Vector Graphics Format
tsv	text/tab-separated-values	Standard TSV format for spreadsheets
txt	text/plain	Plain Text
xls	application/vnd.ms-excel	Microsoft Office Spreadsheet
xlsx	application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet	Microsoft Office Spreadsheet
zip	application/zip	A ZIP file of HTML, Images CSS
--drive-list-chunk int

Size of listing chunk 100-1000. 0 to disable. (default 1000)

--drive-shared-with-me

Only show files that are shared with me

--drive-skip-gdocs

Skip google documents in all listings. If given, gdocs practically become invisible to rclone.

--drive-trashed-only

Only show files that are in the trash. This will show trashed files in their original directory structure.

--drive-upload-cutoff=SIZE

File size cutoff for switching to chunked upload. Default is 8 MB.

--drive-use-trash

Send files to the trash instead of deleting permanently. Defaults to off, namely deleting files permanently.

Limitations
Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting. This causes rclone to be limited to transferring about 2 files per second only. Individual files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MBytes/s but lots of small files can take a long time.

Duplicated files
Sometimes, for no reason I’ve been able to track down, drive will duplicate a file that rclone uploads. Drive unlike all the other remotes can have duplicated files.

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see messages in the log about duplicates.

Use rclone dedupe to fix duplicated files.

Note that this isn’t just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos on Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.

Rclone appears to be re-copying files it shouldn’t
There are two possible reasons for rclone to recopy files which haven’t changed to Google Drive.

The first is the duplicated file issue above - run rclone dedupe and check your logs for duplicate object or directory messages.

The second is that sometimes Google reports different sizes for the Google Docs exports which will cause rclone to re-download Google Docs for no apparent reason. --ignore-size is a not very satisfactory work-around for this if it is causing you a lot of problems.

Google docs downloads sometimes fail with “Failed to copy: read X bytes expecting Y”
This is the same problem as above. Google reports the google doc is one size, but rclone downloads a different size. Work-around with the --ignore-size flag or wait for rclone to retry the download which it will.

Making your own client_id
When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you are using rclone’s client_id. This is shared between all the rclone users. There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per second that each client_id can do set by Google. rclone already has a high quota and I will continue to make sure it is high enough by contacting Google.

However you might find you get better performance making your own client_id if you are a heavy user. Or you may not depending on exactly how Google have been raising rclone’s rate limit.

Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:

Log into the Google API Console with your Google account. It doesn’t matter what Google account you use. (It need not be the same account as the Google Drive you want to access)

Select a project or create a new project.

Under Overview, Google APIs, Google Apps APIs, click “Drive API”, then “Enable”.

Click “Credentials” in the left-side panel (not “Go to credentials”, which opens the wizard), then “Create credentials”, then “OAuth client ID”. It will prompt you to set the OAuth consent screen product name, if you haven’t set one already.

Choose an application type of “other”, and click “Create”. (the default name is fine)

It will show you a client ID and client secret. Use these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an existing remote.
