This is my Plex Project. 
Originally the goal was to move plex completely offsite on a VPS or Dedicated server,
But because my family uses it I wanted to create a user experience and a better way to secure management.


I use several different programs. As I go through my journey, changes and updates and "wiki-like things" will be posted here.
