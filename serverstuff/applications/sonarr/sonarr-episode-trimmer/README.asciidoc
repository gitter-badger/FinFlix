currently not in use but figured i should keep this with my repo
= Sonarr Episode Trimmer

A script for use with Sonarr that allows you to set the number of episodes of a show that you would like to keep.
Useful for shows that air daily.

The script sorts the episodes you have for a show by the season and episode number, and then deletes the oldest episodes
past the threshold you set.


== Configuration

!! took the liberty of editing the url base due to my reverse proxy. See Line 34 !!

Configuration is pretty straight forward as this sample config file shows. The keys under the Series section are the
"cleanTitle" returned from the https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/wiki/Series[Sonarr API]. The values are the number of
episodes you would like to keep for the show. Add a key/value pair for each show you want to clean.

== Usage
-------
usage: sonarr-episode-trimmer.py [-h] [--debug] --config CONFIG
                                 [--list-series] [--custom-script]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --debug          Run the script in debug mode. No modifications to the
                   sonarr library or filesystem will be made.
  --config CONFIG  Path to the configuration file.
  --list-series    Get a list of shows with their 'cleanTitle' for use in the
                   configuration file
  --custom-script  Run in 'Custom Script' mode. This mode is meant for adding
                   the script to sonarr as a 'Custom Script'. It will run
                   anytime a new episode is downloaded, but will only cleanup
                   the series of the downloaded episode.

anytime sonarr processes a new episode.
