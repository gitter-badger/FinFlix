So I use causefx/Organizr as my framework for the website. When he released the show playlist functionality,
I realized that this could be used as a much better way to view "DVR" - *what is that again??*

*This was actually derived from creating a Arrowverse Playlist found somewhere on the r/Plex reddit...*

1. Open Plex, go to your TV Shows.
2. Select `TV Shows` and switch it to `Episodes`
3. Select All and switch it to `Custom Filter`
4. Change the `Show Title` Dropdown to `Air Date`
5. `is before` to `in the last`
6. Type `48` # more on this later
7. `Seconds` to `Hours`
8. Apply
9. Click the `Add to Playlist` button, it looks like a list with a plus sign.
10. New Playlist - `Last Nights TV Shows` - Enter!

## This is what your Filter should look like!!

You now have an auto updating, auto cleansing playlist that will keep the shows that aired *LAST* night in plex.
